CloudStack Test Client

0. Generate API XML spec file
   ant build-apidocs, the output xml file is dist/commands.xml

1. generate Cloudstack API python code from an API XML spec file generated by step 0
   python codegenerator.py  -o where-to-put-the-cloudstack-api -s where-the-spec-file

1a. If you will be running XML based tests, you will need to run them through the
    translator script.  To do that execute translator.py -h for command line help.
    Example:
	python translator.py -i example.xml 

	this will create an example.xml.py script in the current directory.  Run
	that to run the test.


2. Facility it provides:
  1. very handy cloudstack API python wrapper
  2. support async job executing in parallel
  3. remote ssh login/execute command
  4. mysql query 

3. sample code is under unitTest
